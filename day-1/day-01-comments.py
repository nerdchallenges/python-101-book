# Example 1 - Simple, single line comment
# This is a comment and won't be executed by Python
print("However, this line will definitely print!")

# Example 2 - Multi-line comment
# Hey this is a comment
# and so is this! :)
print("This is the second example of a comment")

# Example 3 - Real multi-line comment
'''
This is a multi-line comment
1. The only line that will be actually output by Python is the print statement
2. This line will be ignored. It is just a way for developers to document code.
3. The final program prints `The value of x is 3.`
'''
x = 3
print(f"The value of x is {x}")

# Example 4 - Debugging is fun!
print("Nerd Challenges are awesome!")
# print(Nerd Challenges can be challenging)

# Nerd Challenges
# Kilobyte Challenge - What happens if you add a comment to the same line as a valid Python command?
print("This is a valid python command") # This is a comment

# Megabyte Challenge - What happens if you put a # inside a print statement?
print("This shouldn't print # right...?")
